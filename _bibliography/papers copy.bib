%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of ongoing searches for gravitational wave (GW) sources in the ultra-low-frequency regime (10-9 Hz to 10-7 Hz) using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) will continue to increase in the future as more well-timed pulsars are added to the arrays. It is expected that next-generation radio telescopes, namely, the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), will grow the number of well-timed pulsars to O(103). The higher sensitivity will result in greater distance reach for GW sources, uncovering multiple resolvable GW sources in addition to an unresolved population. Data analysis techniques that can search for and resolve multiple signals present simultaneously in PTA data are, therefore, required. The multisource resolution problem in PTA data analysis poses a unique set of challenges such as nonuniformly sampled data, a large number of so-called pulsar phase parameters that arise from the inaccurately measured distances to the pulsars, and poor separation of signals in the Fourier domain due to a small number of cycles in the observed waveforms. We present a method that can address these challenges and demonstrate its performance on simulated data from PTAs with 102 to 103 pulsars. The method estimates and subtracts sources from the data iteratively using multiple stages of refinement, followed by a step that mitigates spurious identified sources by comparing the outputs from two different algorithms. The performance of the method compares favorably with the global fit approaches that have been proposed so far. In all the cases tested in this work, the fraction of sources found by the method that correspond to true sources in the simulated data exceeds 78\% and 93\% for a large-scale (with 103 pulsars and 200 sources) and a midscale (with 102 pulsars and 100 sources) PTA, respectively. The network signal-to-noise ratio of the recovered true sources reaches down to 16.43 for the large-scale and 9.07 for the midscale PTA.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Detecting continuous nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) generated by individual close binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs) is one of the primary objectives of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The detection sensitivity is slated to increase significantly as the number of well-timed millisecond pulsars will increase by more than an order of magnitude with the advent of next-generation radio telescopes. Currently, the Bayesian analysis pipeline using parallel tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo has been applied in multiple studies for CB-SMBH searches, but it may be challenged by the high dimensionality of the parameter space for future large-scale PTAs. One solution is to reduce the dimensionality by maximizing or marginalizing over uninformative parameters semianalytically, but it is not clear whether this approach can be extended to more complex signal models without making overly simplified assumptions. Recently, the method of diffusive nested (DNest) sampling has shown capability in coping with high dimensionality and multimodality effectively in Bayesian analysis. In this paper, we apply DNest to search for continuous GWs in simulated pulsar timing residuals and find that it performs well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency for a PTA including                                                                                                                                                                   (                                                               10                                                                 2                                                           )                                                                pulsars. DNest also allows a simultaneous search of multiple sources elegantly, which demonstrates its scalability and general applicability. Our results show that it is convenient and also highly beneficial to include DNest in current toolboxes of PTA analysis.},

Search algorithms for such targets must contend with the large number of so-called pulsar phase parameters in the joint log-likelihood function of the data. We compare the localization accuracy for two approaches: Maximization over the pulsar phase parameters (MaxPhase) against marginalization over them (AvPhase). Using simulated data from a pulsar timing array with 17 pulsars, we find that for weak and moderately strong signals, AvPhase outperforms MaxPhase significantly, while they perform comparably for strong signals.},
